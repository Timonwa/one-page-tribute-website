          <h3>Who is Justin Bieber</h3>
          <p>
            Justin Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in 1994 in
            Stratford, Ontario, Canada, to a single mother, Bieber took second
            place in a local talent competition at a young age. After his mother
            posted YouTube clips of her boy performing, Bieber went from an
            unknown, untrained singer to a budding superstar with a big-time
            record deal with Usher within two years. Bieber went on to become
            the first solo artist to have four singles enter the Top 40 before
            the release of a debut album. His 2009 album, My World, went
            platinum in several countries. He later experienced significant
            media exposure from offensive activity. Nonetheless, the singer made
            his comeback in 2015 with his first number one song, "What Do You
            Mean?" His 2017 collaboration with Luis Fonsi, “Despacito,” broke
            the all-time record for most consecutive weeks at the number one
            spot on the Top 100. Bieber broke another record in early 2020 when
            the success of Changes made him the youngest artist to have seven
            albums reach the top spot on the Billboard Hot 200.

          <h3>Justin Bieber’s Albums and Songs</h3>
          <p>
            Bieber’s debut album, My World, hit stores in November 2009, selling
            more than 137,000 copies within a week. In 2010, Bieber released My
            World 2.0, which offered his growing fan base 10 new songs. Never
            Say Never was released in 2011, with a holiday album, Under the
            Mistletoe, coming out the same year. In 2012, the album Believe sold
            374,000 copies in its first week, before the disappointment of the
            following year's Journals, a downbeat album without a hit single.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bieber made a big comeback in 2015 with Purpose, which became his
            fifth million-selling record in the U.S. by the end of the year.
            Following the release of Changes in February 2020, the 25-year-old
            became the youngest artist to have seven albums reach the top spot
            on the Billboard Hot 200, breaking the record once held by a
            26-year-old Elvis Presley.
